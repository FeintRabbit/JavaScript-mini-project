## NOTES:

Project 8 (menu)

- Good use of arr methods for displaying JSON data on DOM
- Map(), looping over JSON data and building HTML for innerhtml insert to DOM
- Filter(), on event (click btn) filter data then call the above for filtered data
- Reduce(), start with arr ['all'] then add vals based on condition

Project 11 (tabs)

- Example of using event delegation to manipulate child elements from a delegated parent

Project 14 (grocery bud to-do list)

- Add to DOM - Adding item to the DOM is done line-by-line for each element (not using map all the HTML blob)
- Event delegation - avoiding event delegation for the buttons, by adding event listeners as they are added to the DOM
- JSON stringify & parse, CRUD values in local storage
- minor use of filter & map
